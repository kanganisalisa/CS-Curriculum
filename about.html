        <h2>Who Developed This Course?</h2>
        <p>
            This curriculum was developed by four Williams College undergraduate students 
            and Professor of Computer Science Jeannie Albrecht.
        </p>
        <h2>Why Was This Course Developed?</h2>
        <p>
            We built this curriculum because we noticed an absence of effective computer science 
            curriculums for young students. Most existing curriculums lack cohesion,
            accessibility, and content. 
        </p>
        <p>
            This curriculum was developed with the primary goal of providing students with a 
            successful first impression of computer science. It is designed to be accessible, 
            portable, inclusive, and above all, interesting and entertaining for children. 
        </p>
        <h2>Why Study Computer Science?</h2>
        <p>
            While this curriculum teaches students how to program, it more importantly teaches 
            them how to think like a programmer. Programmers employ computational thinking to 
            efficiently solve problems. This involves decomposing problems into smaller tasks, 
            recognizing patterns, designing algorithms, and debugging and refining those algorithms. 
        </p>
        <p>
            The logic and reasoning skills cultivated by computational thinking, regardless of 
            whether a student decides to pursue a career in computer science, are invaluable. 
        </p>

        <h2>The Importance of Making Computer Science Accessible </h2>
        <p>
            Although technology occupations are among the <a href="https://www.bls.gov/ooh/computer-and-information-technology/home.htm" target="_blank">fastest growing careers</a>, the industry severely lacks diversity. 
        </p> 
        <p>
            Only <a href="https://dataprot.net/statistics/women-in-tech-statistics/#:~:text=Women%20in%20tech%20statistics%20shed,gap%20in%20the%20technology%20business.&text=Only%2024%25%20of%20computing%20jobs,45%25%20higher%20rate%20than%20men." target="_blank">19% of STEM graduates are women and just 24% of computing jobs are held by women</a>.
            Gender stereotypes related to STEM ability <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0193397319300930" target="_blank">emerge at a young age</a>.  
            These stereotypes are then enforced by imbalanced gender participation in STEM in schools and later in the workforce.
            We hope that early intervention and exposure to a STEM education can help strike down gender stereotypes and inspire more women to pursue their interest in STEM. 

        </p>
        <p>
            Furthermore,  this curriculum is built so if educators do not have the resources to purchase Lego Kits or buy expensive computer science curricula, they can still use this curriculum. Through slides, unplugged activities, simple plugged activities, and tracing activities* educators have plenty of resources to teach computer science to anyone, regardless of socioeconomic status. Anyone can be a computer scientist!

        <h2>Resources</h2>
        <p>
            Much of the information in this curriculum is based on our own Williams 
            College Introduction to Computer Science <a href="https://www.cs.williams.edu/~cs134/" target="_blank">lectures</a>. 
            Our slides cover many of the same principles, only in a simpler fashion. 
            Additionally, some activities and lessons are derived from Jeannie's 
            <a href="http://sysnet.cs.williams.edu/~jeannie/lego-camp-2021/day1.html" target="_blank">Lego Robotics Summer Camp</a>.

        <p>
            This is an ongoing project which we expect to extend and refine. If you have any comments or
