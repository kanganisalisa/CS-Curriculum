        <h2>Who Developed This Course?</h2>
        <p>
            This curriculum was developed by four Williams College undergraduate students 
            under Professor of Computer Science Jeannie Albrecht.
        </p>
        <h2>Why Was This Course Developed?</h2>
        <p>
            We built this curriculum because we noticed an absence of effective computer science 
            curriculums for young studentsâ€”primarily of elementary school age. Most existing 
            curriculums lack cohesion, accessibility, and engaging activities. 
        </p>
        <p>
            This curriculum was developed with the primary goal of providing students with a 
            successful first impression of computer science. It is designed to be accessible, 
            portable, inclusive, and above all, interesting and entertaining for children. 
        </p>
        <h2>Why Take This Course?</h2>
        <p>
            While this curriculum teaches students how to program, it more importantly teaches 
            them how to think like a programmer. Programmers employ computational thinking to 
            efficiently solve problems. This involves decomposing problems into smaller tasks, 
            recognizing patterns, designing algorithms, and debugging and refining those algorithms. 
        </p>
        <p>
            The logic and reasoning skills cultivated by computational thinking, regardless of 
            whether a student decides to pursue a career in computer science, are invaluable to 
            any occupation and life in general. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Much of the information in this curriculum is derived from and based on our own Williams 
            College Introduction to Computer Science lectures. Our slides cover the same principles, 
            only in a simpler fashion.
