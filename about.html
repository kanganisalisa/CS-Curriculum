        <h2>Who Developed This Course?</h2>
        <p>
            This curriculum was developed by four Williams College undergraduate students 
            and Professor of Computer Science Jeannie Albrecht.
        </p>
        <h2>Why Was This Course Developed?</h2>
        <p>
            We built this curriculum because we noticed an absence of effective computer science 
            curriculums for young students. Most existing curriculums lack cohesion,
            accessibility, and content. 
        </p>
        <p>
            This curriculum was developed with the primary goal of providing students with a 
            successful first impression of computer science. It is designed to be accessible, 
            portable, inclusive, and above all, interesting and entertaining for children. 
        </p>
        <h2>The Importance of Making Computer Science Accessible</h2>
        <p>
            While this curriculum teaches students how to program, it more importantly teaches 
            them how to think like a programmer. Programmers employ computational thinking to 
            efficiently solve problems. This involves decomposing problems into smaller tasks, 
            recognizing patterns, designing algorithms, and debugging and refining those algorithms. 
        </p>
        <p>
            The logic and reasoning skills cultivated by computational thinking, regardless of 
            whether a student decides to pursue a career in computer science, are invaluable. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Furthermore, technology-related occupations are among the <a href="https://www.bls.gov/ooh/computer-and-information-technology/home.htm" target="_blank">fastest growing careers</a> 
            and the greatest barrier to entry is arguably access to a computer science education.
        </p>
        <h2>Resources</h2>
        <p>
            Much of the information in this curriculum is based on our own Williams 
            College Introduction to Computer Science <a href="https://www.cs.williams.edu/~cs134/" target="_blank">lectures</a>. 
            Our slides cover many of the same principles, only in a simpler fashion. 
            Additionally, some activities and lessons are derived from Jeannie's 
            <a href="http://sysnet.cs.williams.edu/~jeannie/lego-camp-2021/day1.html" target="_blank">Lego Robotics Summer Camp</a>. 
        </p>
        <h2>Feedback</h2>
        <p>
            This is an ongoing project which we expect to extend and refine. If you have any comments or 
            critiques as you use this curriculum, please feel welcome to anonymously send us feedback with
