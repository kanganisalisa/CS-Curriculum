        <h2>Curriculum Layout</h2>
        <p>
            The curriculum is divided into three levels of progressive difficulty.  
        </p>
        <p>
            Level 1 is intended for children with no prior knowledge in computer science. It 
            familiarizes students with using their computers and introduces them to the rudimentary
            topics of programming. Most of the activities are unplugged, but some involve block 
            programming with Scratch and the Lego Spike Essential. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Level 2 uses coding to implement the topics learned in the previous level while also 
            introducing more difficult topics such as loops, functions, and parameters. This level 
            includes a balanced mix of unplugged and plugged activities. The plugged activities range 
            from block programming with Scratch and the Lego Spike Prime to using Python with lab 
            activities and the Lego Mindstorm.
        </p>
        <p>
            Level 3 is the most advanced level. It continues to build on previous topics, such as 
            conditionals and loops, while again introducing complex topics fundamental to more advanced 
            programming, such as data structures and objects. The activities in this level are primarily 
            plugged, focusing on using Python with lab activities, the Lego Spike Prime, and the Lego 
            Mindstorm. 
        </p>

        <h2>Resources</h2>
        <p>
            Each individual topic in the curriculum is equipped with the following resources, with the 
            exception of certain topics where some activities are not applicable.  
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Slide Deck: The slides include an in-depth explanation of the concept,  supplemented with examples.</li>
            <li>Unplugged Activities: These are activities that do not require a computer. They are helpful for providing a conceptual understanding.</li>
            <li>Plugged Activities: These activities do require at least a computer. They involve using either Scratch, Python, or a Lego robot.</li>
            <li>Tracing Problems: These problems involve reading and interpreting lines of code. They help students acquire the habit of reading code less linearly.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Additionally, every level of the curriculum has a final assessment. This is for students to gauge 
            their understanding of the topics learned at that level. 
        </p>

        <h2>Materials</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Scratch: Scratch is a free block-based programming environment developed by MIT. It has a simple drag and drop interface that is easy for kids to learn, and it can be used to make stories, games, and animations.</li>
            <li>Python: Python is arguably the most readable language, making it a top choice for entry-level programmers. Williams College uses Python in their Introduction to Computer Science course, which much of this curriculum is based on.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            The following Lego robots are optional. We realize that these pose a significant price-barrier 
            to many, and the curriculum can be completed without them. But if attainable, they add an 
            engaging element for students.

        <h2>How to Use This Curriculum</h2>
        <p>
            This curriculum is essentially a collection of resources to choose from. Within each topic there 
            are plugged activities, unplugged activities, and tracing problems, but as the course is 
            completed it is not necessary that a student does all every activity and problem. The student or teacher 
            should select activities that they want to use to form their own lessons. We have included some 
            suggested lesson plans in each level to showcase how this can be done. 
        </p>
        <p>
            This way, the curriculum can be flexible enough to be used in different settings, including 
            schools, summer camps, extracurricular programs, or even at home. Furthermore, some of the 
            simpler descriptions and activities in the earlier levels can be used to supplement more 
            difficult topics in the following levels. 
        </p>
        <h2>Don't Know Where to Begin?</h2>
        <p>
            While each level is tagged with a suggested age group, we recognize that computer science 
            knowledge is staggered among young students due to absence of standardized curriculums in
            schools. The age suggestions are therefore loose and more-so intended to serve as a guideline 
            the maturity required to complete the topics and activities in each level. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Are you or your student unsure of where to begin? We have placement quizzes for each level. 
            The score will indicate whether a student should take that level or move onto the next one.
