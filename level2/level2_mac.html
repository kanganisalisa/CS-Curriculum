        <h2>Setting Up Mac Environment</h2>

        <h3>Step 0: Verify macOS Version</h3>
        <p>
            You must have macOS 10.15 or 11 installed. If you have an older version, you need to upgrade it 
            (for free). To find your macOS version, click on the “Apple” icon on the top left of the screen, 
            and then on “About this Mac”.
        </p>
        <p>
            If at any point in the setup process below you are prompted to install Xcode or Rosetta, please 
            do so. These tools are essential to make this setup work.
        </p>

        <h3>Step 1: Install Visual Studio Code</h3>
        <p>
            Install the latest version <a href ="https://code.visualstudio.com/" target="_blank">here</a> and 
            proceed with the default options for any choices you have.
        </p>
    
        <h3>Step 2: Install Python</h3>
        <p>
            We’ll be using the Python programming language, version 3. You must install Python3. We suggest 
            you do a fresh install even if you have an older python version available.
        </p>
        <p>
            Go to <a href = "https://www.python.org/downloads/" taget="_blank">https://www.python.org/downloads/</a>. 
            It should give you a download specific to your machine. Be sure the download option’s version number starts 
            with 3.9 or 3.10. Once downloaded, click and install the package. Provide your Mac password, if necessary. 
        </p>
        <p>
            After the installation, a Finder window opens to the Python 3.9 applications. It contains two useful 
            scripts we suggest you run: (a) Double-click on Install Certificates.command. This will be helpful in 
            establishing secure connections. When it is finished, dismiss the window. (b) Double-click on Update 
            Shell Profile.command. This will make sure this version of Python is the preferred version.
        </p>

        <h3>Step 3 (Optional): Install the EV3 Micropython Extension</h3>
        <p>
            If you plan on using a LEGO EV3 kit with python you will need to to install an extension 
            on Visual Studio code. You can follow <a href = "https://pybricks.com/ev3-micropython/startinstall.html#preparing-your-computer" target="_blank">these</a> instructions.
        </p>

        <h3>Step 4 (Optional): Install the SPIKE App</h3>
        <p>
            If you plan on using a LEGO SPIKE kit you can install the app directly 
            from the Microsoft store <a href = "https://apps.microsoft.com/store/detail/spike%E2%84%A2-lego%C2%AE-education/9NFQZ9RDND2Q?hl=en-us&gl=US" target="_blank">here</a>.
